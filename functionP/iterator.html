//iterator is an object that implements iteration protocol
//An iterator object must have a next method that when called will provide
//an object with a done property and value property
//iterable object are those that have a method,found at [Symbol.iterator]
//when it is called they return an iterable object


//string is built in iterator object
var something = 'hi';
console.log(typeof something[Symbol.iterator]);//function
var iterator = something[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(iterator.next());//{value: "h", done: false}
console.log(iterator.next());//{value: "i", done: false}
console.log(iterator.next());//{value: "undefined", done: true}

//spread use iteration protocol
console.log([...something])//["h", "i"]

//iterables
//string,array,typedArray,Map and Set - implement @@Iterator
